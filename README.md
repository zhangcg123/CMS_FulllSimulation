  - Step:6: CMSSWVersion, Python Config

# General Information

For the CMSSW full simulation, first choose the campaign which is closest to your analysis.

1. Select one campaign. For example I choose: [https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/mcm/requests?prepid=B2G-RunIIAutumn18NanoAODv6-01916&page=0&shown=127](https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/mcm/requests?prepid=B2G-RunIIAutumn18NanoAODv6-01916&page=0&shown=127)

2. Go to the chains and select each chain one by one and do the following for each of them.

   1. On "Actions" click on "view chains": you will see a chain of McM processes connected by arrows and ending with your chosen NanoAOD sample.
   1. For *each* of these processes (click on them one by one), on "Actions" click on "get setup command" to get a piece of bash script - in this case 4 pieces.
   1. Save each pieced in different `<filename>_1.sh, <filename>_2.sh, <filename>_3.sh, <filename>_4.sh` files.
   1. Brief introduction of each file is given here[^intro_files].

[^intro_files]: First step is known as the GEN-SIM step. Second one is DR1 and DR2 third one will generate MINIAOD and finally the fourth one will create the NanoAOD files.

3. Now run each script one by one. First script will give you one *.py file 2nd one should give you two *.py files and third and fourth one should give you one *.py files each.

3. Now append the random number generator at the end of first *.py file. So, that each time when you generate the GEN-SIM file from the gridpack it will generate independent set of events else it will just generate the same copies each time.
   
   patch to add random number generator:
   
   ```bash
   cat << EOF >> testLHE-GEN.py
   from IOMC.RandomEngine.RandomServiceHelper import RandomNumberServiceHelper
   randSvc = RandomNumberServiceHelper(process.RandomNumberGeneratorService)
   randSvc.populate()
   EOF
   ```
   
   where, `testLHE-GEN.py` is the name of first configuration file.
   
   **NOTE**: Also in the first *.py you need to see if the initial, final and intermediate states are not same then you might need to edit the pythia fragment part. Generally, this part [B2G-RunIIFall18wmLHEGS-01725_1_cfg.py#L98-L162](https://github.com/ram1123/CMS_FulllSimulation/blob/3fb13d4dffe1b3160b1616a4b2ac569f42b84207/B2G-RunIIFall18wmLHEGS-01725_1_cfg.py#L98-L162)

4. Test each python configuration one after another in appropriate sequence to check if its fine. *There might be an issue of name of input root files. The script might not taking the input of previous step automatically because of naming difference. So you need to fix it.*

5. Finally submit the condor job.


# Condor Job Submission

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ram1123/CMS_FulllSimulation.git
cd CMS_FulllSimulation
git submodule init
```

1. place all the python configuration file inside the directory `CMS_FulllSimulation`.
2. Update the `RunGENSIM_condor.jdl` and `RunGENSIM_condor.sh` files.
    1. In file `RunGENSIM_condor.sh` you need to replace the python configuration file name at appropriate places.
    1. Add the appropriate number of events and jobs. For example:
        1. If you want 50k events then you can change `Queue 50` in the jdl file and put 1000 in each python configuration files.
1. submit the condor jobs.

```bash
voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 168:00
condor_submit RunGENSIM_condor.jdl
```
